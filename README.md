a c64 simple shooter 
this is the first of yet commodore c64 game I made from scratch 
and it doesn't use the cia (because I'm living in the middle east) 
but it's made by characters screen and not sprites for mostly learning purpose 
and gaining experiencend it's very simple and has a bunch of known issues .
I'll make corrections as I go of course.
it uses "acme" assembler syntaxes.
